### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Machine Learning and playing with quantum computers (Professionally, I studied quantum computation as part of my formation as theoretical physicst). Also currently I am doing frontier research in quantum physics in the _Research Center for Quantum Information_ In the _Slovak Academy of Sciences_ in Bratislava.
- Edditing this
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading advanced literature on Machine Learning 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Global Warming fighting and so on.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with solutions to make Global Warming less worse.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any topic in physics, especially quantum physics, thermodynamics and mathematical physics.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Linkedin.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I don't take language too seriously. Do math, it is truly a language worth thinking about. The most precise language humans have ever invented.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't like to work at all (just joking... or am I?), so I am constantly looking for ways to perform any task efficiently and reliably. For example making tools for repetitive tasks.
- :last_quarter_moon: Another fact: I am a stutter person.
