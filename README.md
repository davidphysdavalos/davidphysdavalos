### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Machine Learning and playing with quantum computers (Professionally, I studied quantum computation as part of my formation as theoretical physicst). Also currently I am doing frontier research in quantum physics and mathematical physics in the _Research Center for Quantum Information_ In the _Slovak Academy of Sciences_ in Bratislava.
- 🌱 I use to read advanced literature on Machine Learning, my backgroud is helpful for it. I don't like to just use existing python modules, I like and want to understand.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Global Warming fighting and any interesting and/or useful endeavor.
- 🤔 I’m looking to help with solutions to make Global Warming less worse.
- 💬 Ask me about any topic in physics, especially quantum physics, thermodynamics and mathematical physics.
- 📫 How to reach me: Linkedin, rise an issue in some repo.
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't take language too seriously. Do math, it is truly a language worth thinking about. The most precise language humans have ever invented.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't like to work at all (just joking), but the fact is that I am constantly looking for ways to perform any task more efficiently and reliably. For example making tools to perform repetitive tasks.
- :last_quarter_moon: Another fact: I am a stutter person.
