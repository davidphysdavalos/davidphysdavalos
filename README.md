### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Machine Learning (training steps) and playing with quantum computers (I professionally studied quantum computation). Also currently I am doing frontier research in quantum physics in the _Research Center for Quantum Information_ In the _Slovak Academy of Sciences_ in Bratislava.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning libraries
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Global Warming fighting and on.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with solutions to make Global Warming less worse.
- 💬 Ask me about any topic in physics, especially quantum physics, thermodynamics and mathematical physics.
- 📫 How to reach me: Linkedin.
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't take language too seriously. Do math, it is truly a language worth thinking about. The most precise language humans have ever invented.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't like to work at all (just joking... or am I?), so I am constantly looking for ways to perform any task efficiently and reliably. For example making tools for repetitive tasks.
- :last_quarter_moon: Another fact: I am a stutter person.
